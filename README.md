# Exercises from `C Programming: A Modern Approach 1st Ed`

This repo contains the exercises from `C Programming: A Modern Approach 1st Ed` by `K. N. King`.
These exercises were done using Visual Studio Code on MacOS.
Shortcuts may differ for different OSes.

There a multiple compilers for C code. 
The most popular are `clang` and `gcc`. I have decided to use `clang` which is bundled with `XCode`.

As I worked through the exercises more and more, I noticed that I knew most of the concepts and decided to skip almost all of them apart from the advanced topics which I needed to work on.


## Visual Studio Code Settings
Install the `C/C++` extension from `Microsoft`.

`User` -> `Extensions` -> `Formatting` -> `C_Cpp: Clang_format_sort Includes` -> `true`
